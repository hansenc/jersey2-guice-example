jersey2-guice-example
=====================

This is an example of using [Squarespace/jersey2-guice](https://github.com/Squarespace/jersey2-guice) with embedded Jetty. There are other unrelated repositories with the same name, but the use of the `jersey2-guice` library (as opposed to the HK2/Guice bridge, for example) is a major difference.
